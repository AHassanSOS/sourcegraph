# Proposal process

Changes to our product or architecture are proposed, discussed, and approved according to the following process:

1. Propose a change by opening a PR to add a new document to this directory that follows the [template](0000-00-00-template.md). The file name has the following components:
  - The date the proposal was first authored (YYYY-MM-DD).
  - The dash (`-`) separated title.
  - The markdown (`.md`) suffix.
2. Request a review from your manager and other relevant owners. The reviews are expected to respond to new and updated proposals within 48 hours (excluding weekends and holidays). It is appropriate to ping reviewers after 24 hours. The entire process should not take longer than one week. If a proposal is not approved within a week, the manager will make a final judgement call whether a project is approved as written or rejected.
4. When the proposal is approved, copy the implementation checklist into a new issue that links to the proposal's PR and link to this issue from the proposal. Further changes to the checklist are reflected in the issue and not the proposal.
5. Merge the proposal.
6. Complete the checklist. You should update the checklist in the issue as necessary throughout the project.
7. After the project is done, fill out the retrospective portion of the proposal.
